/**
* @title Cryptolotto6Hours
* @dev This smart contract is a part of Cryptolotto (cryptolotto.cc) product.
*
* @dev Cryptolotto is a blockchain-based, Ethereum powered lottery which gives to users the most 
* @dev transparent and honest chances of winning.
*
* @dev The main idea of Cryptolotto is straightforward: people from all over the world during the 
* @dev set period of time are contributing an equal amount of ETH to one wallet. When a timer ends 
* @dev this smart-contract powered wallet automatically sends all received ETHs to a one randomly 
* @dev chosen wallet-participant.
*
* @dev Due to the fact that Cryptolotto is built on a blockchain technology, it eliminates any 
* @dev potential for intervention by third parties and gives 100% guarantee of an honest game.
* @dev There are no backdoors and no human or computer soft can interfere the process of picking a winner.
*
* @dev If during the game only one player joins it, then the player will receive all his ETH back.
* @dev If a player sends not the exact amount of ETH - he will receive all his ETH back.
* @dev Creators of the product can change the entrance price for the game. If the price is changed 
* @dev then new rules are applied when a new game starts.
*
* @dev The original idea of Cryptolotto belongs to t.me/crypto_god and t.me/crypto_creator - Founders. 
* @dev Cryptolotto smart-contracts are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, 
* @dev other intellectual property, proprietary rights laws and other applicable laws.
*
* @dev All information related to the product can be found only on: 
* @dev - cryptolotto.cc
* @dev - github.com/cryptolotto
* @dev - instagram.com/cryptolotto
* @dev - facebook.com/cryptolotto
